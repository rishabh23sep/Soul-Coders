## Round 2

Experiment 1: Arithmetic Operator

### 1. Story Outline:

<div align="justify"> The experiment involves the use of Go simulator implementing various arithmetic operations. Performing arithmetic operations on large numbers can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new user can easily perform arithmetic operations and can implement in various Go programs.

### 2. Story:

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
<h2>Construction of the set-up</h2>

For better visualization, a simulator is provided. A simulation can always act as the best possible alternative to learn. the simulator is divided into three sections: <br>
➢	Input Section: Helps in interacting with the user (accepting numbers as inputs).<br>
➢	Code Section: Displays the subsequent code for each type of choice the user takes to perform any operation.<br>
➢	Output Section: Displays the output that will be generated after the code runs successfully.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>recall the various arithmetic operations. | Recall | Identify
2.| User will be able to: <br>understand the types of arithmetic operators in Go programming language <br>and how to perform various arithmetic operations.  | Understand| Describe
3.| User will be able to: <br>implement/use arithmetic operators on input values in Go programs. | Apply | Implement
4.| User will be able to: <br>take the quiz to evaluate what they learnt and enhance his capabilities. | Analyze| Examine

Enhance conceptual and logical skill

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

The simulator tab would allow:<br> <br>
<dd> 1. The setup consists of a simulator that helps in performing arithmetic operations with the use of Go Compiler.<br>
2. Additionally, there will be three sections to work upon: Input Section, Code Section and Output Section.<br>
3. The code section will display the code for the type of operation you want to perform.<br>
4. Once the experiment has been performed, you can take the quiz.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Assessment Questions:<br>

<dd><b> 1. Arithmetic operators are usually-<br>
a.	Unary<br>
b.	Binary<br>
c.	Ternary<br>
d.	None of the Above<br></dd><br></b><br>
<dd><b>2.	Which of the following can be operands of arithmetic operators?<br>
a.	Numeric<br>
b.	Boolean<br>
c.	Characters<br>
d.	Both a & c
<br><br></b>
<dd>
<b> 3. Is Go Language object oriented?<br>
a)	Yes<br>
b)	No<br>
c)	Can't say<br>
d)	None of these<br></b>
</dd>




##### 2.6 Conclusion:
<dd>The Go compiler has a number of arithmetic operations. They are loaded automatically as the compiler starts and are always available. Thus, it makes it easier for a programmer to perform small but complex operations with ease.
