## Round 3
### <b>Aim</b>
In this experiment the User will be able to understand the types of arithmetic operators in Go programming language and how to perform various arithmetic operations by using an interactive simulator.
### <b>Theory</b>
 <h3><b>Principle:</b></h3>
                   <div align="justify"> It involves the use of Go simulator implementing various arithmetic operations. Performing arithmetic operations on large numbers can be a difficult job to accomplish. This difficulty can be countered with the help of Go simulator that provides a friendly programming environment to the beginners, so that every new user can easily perform arithmetic operations and can implement in various Go programs. <br>
                    <h3><b>Theory of Arithmetic Operator:</b></h3>
                    Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of the Go language is incomplete without the use of Arithmetic operators.<br>
                    These are used to perform arithmetic operations on operands in Go language:<br>
                    Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.<br>
                    Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.<br>
                    Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.<br>
                    Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.<br>  
                    
### <b>Procedure</b>
<h4>Steps of simulator :</h4>
                    1. Enter the First Number.<br>
                    2. Enter the Second Number.<br>
                    3. Select the operation.<br>
                    4. Click the Execute button to start the program.<br>
                    5. Click the next instruction button to scan each line of code.<br>
                    6. Click the reset button if you want to restart the simulator.<br>

</dd>
               
        
### <b>Post Test</b>
<dd>1. In which of the following method of parameter passing, changes made to the parameter inside the function have effect on the argument?<br>
a.	call by value<br>
b.	call by reference<br>
c.	Both of the above<br>
d.	None of the Above<br></dd><br><br>
<dd>2.	Which of the following is true about local variables in Go?<br>
a.	Variables that are declared inside a function or block are called local variables.<br>
b.	They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code.<br>
c.	Local variables are not known to functions outside their own.<br>
d.	All of the above
<br><br>
<dd>
 3. What are the advantages of GO?<br>
a)	GO compiles very quickly<br>
b)	Go supports concurrency at the language level<br>
c)	Functions are firstclass objects in GO<br>
d)	All of these<br>
</dd>
