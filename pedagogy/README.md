<u> <b>Description: </b> In this experiment you will learn about the types of arithmetic operators in Go programming language: </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify">•	The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.
<br>
•	The learner will be easily able to understand Computer Sciences.<br>
•	The user will able to understand various operators used in the Go programming language.<br>
•	With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn various arithmetic operators as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of Computer Sciences which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
Examine the simulator screen and take note of all the instructions. | Display all the simulator contents.  |<div align = "justify">  Display simulator interface.
Select the type of arithmetic operator you want to use.  | Bring the selected operator for use.  |<div align = "justify"> To select an arithmetic operator for performing the mathematical operations.
Enter input values if required.  | Input fields will take input if necessary.  |<div align = "justify"> To take input values on which operations to be performed.
Click on the  “Start” button  | It displays the code for that operation in Go programming language. |<div align = "justify"> To present a code to the user for better understanding.
Press “Next ” button.  | Highlights each executing line and its output.  |<div align = "justify"> To explain the steps involved and meaning of each line of code.
Press “Reset" button.  | Reset the simulator for a fresh start. |<div align = "justify"> To perform a fresh experiment.
