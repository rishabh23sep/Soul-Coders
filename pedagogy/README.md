Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> In this experiment you will learn about the types of arithmetic operators in Go programming language: </u>
<br>
 <div align="justify">•	The main objective to develop this lab is to provide an interactive source of learning for the students. The simulation that we provide fulfills our purpose.
<br>
•	The learner will be easily able to understand Computer Sciences.<br>
•	The user will able to understand various operators used in the Go programming language.<br>
•	With the help of our virtual lab, students get a chance to learn various arithmetic operators as they are provided with an interactive simulator. It is beneficial in understanding the basics of Computer Sciences which simply cannot be understood by self-evaluation.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| LO1 | User is asked to select Arithmetic operators from dropdown. | <div align="justify"> What is a , b in simulator ? <br> variable <br>memory location
2.| LO1 | User has to click on next instruction button. | <div align="justify">What do you understand by fmt.Print function ?<br>print value on screen<br>Take input from user
3.| LO4 | User write code to perform arithmetic operation. |<div align="justify"> Whether student get desired output?
4.| LO3 | User will write the missing part in code. | <div align = "justify"> Whether syntax are correct or not ?

What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:-:
User will enter values of a & b and select operation from dropdown. | Simulator will run algorithm , display output of each step of algorithm.  |<div align = "justify">  Understand the basic syntax of Go programming.
User will click on next instruction tab.  | Simulator will show the working of each instruction on the right side pane of simulator.  |<div align = "justify"> Understand instruction of algorithm step by step.
User will write a program in Go Language editor.  | Simulator will check for errors. | <div align = "justify">To check whether student has understand basic syntax of Go programming.
User will fill the missing blanks in program.  | Simulator will show the program query.  |<div align = "justify"> Identify the conceptual clarity of syntactical checking
